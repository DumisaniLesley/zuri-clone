# zuri-clone
Replicate the landing page, the “I’m new to the industry page” and the “I need industry experience”. You can go further if you wish to. You are not restricted from using frameworks. Your site should be responsive across all screen sizes in your browser's development tool section. (Use more percentages rather than fixed units like pixels to make things easier for you).
